# Pusher Realtime Chat Example

The goal of this project is to show step-by-step how to build
a realtime chat application with [Pusher][pusher] and [Ruby on Rails][rails].

## Prerequisites

- [RVM](http://rvm.io/)
- [Rails][rails]
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
$ cd ~/your-project-folder

# Create a gemset named pusher-realtime-chat-example
$ rvm use 2.1.1@pusher-realtime-chat-example --create

$ gem install rails
$ rails new pusher-realtime-chat-example --skip-test-unit

$ cd pusher-realtime-chat-example

# Create the .ruby-version and .ruby-gemset files so that
# whenever you return to the project directory it will
# automatically use the correct Ruby version and gemset
$ rvm use 2.1.1@pusher-realtime-chat-example --ruby-version

$ bin/rails s
```

Now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. If  everything was
set up correctly you'd see the "Welcome aboard" page as shown below.

![Welcome aboard](doc/assets/images/ruby-on-rails-welcome-aboard.png)

Great! Let's commit.

```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Iteration 1

```bash
# Create a new branch named iteration-1 and switch into it
git checkout -b iteration-1
```

I find it helpful to approach problems I've never tackled before in many small
iterations until I reach the final result. Each iteration should get me one or
more steps closer to the outcome I want to achieve.

In this iteration I want the user to be able to enter their name and a message
into a form and be able to send that information to the server for "processing".
The details are intentionally vague to leave room for architectural design and
development freedom.

Open your `config/routes.rb` file and add the following:

```ruby
root 'chat_messsages#index'
```

If we now start our server

```bash
$ bin/rails s
```

and navigate to http://localhost:3000 we'd see the following page:

![Uninitialized constant ChatMessagesController](doc/assets/images/uninitialized-constant-chat-messages-controller.png)

Let's add the `ChatMessagesController`.

Navigating to http://localhost:3000 we get:

![Unknown action index ChatMessagesController](doc/assets/images/unknown-action-index-chat-messages-controller.png)

Let's add an empty `index` action and add the view `app/views/chat_messages/index.html.erb`
one time. Within the view file we'd start building out the form.

```html
<%= form_for @chat_message do |f| %>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :name %>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= f.label :message %>
    <%= f.text_area :message, rows: 5, cols: 40 %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= f.submit 'Send' %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

Reloading the page we encounter an error with `@chat_message` not being set.

![chat_message is nil](doc/assets/images/chat-message-nil.png)

To fix that we can make the following changes:

```ruby
# app/controllers/chat_messages_controller.rb

def index
  @chat_message = ChatMessage.new
end
```

and

```ruby
# app/models/chat_message.rb

class ChatMessage
  include ActiveModel::Model
  attr_accessor :name, :message
end
```

I chose not to inherit from [`ActiveRecord::Base`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html)
since I don't need persistence. However, I do need it to work with [`form_for`][form_for]
hence the [`ActiveModel::Model`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Model.html)
mixin.

That fixes the previous error but we have a new problem:

![Undefined method chat_messages_path](doc/assets/images/undefined-method-chat-messages-path.png)

By default the [`form_for`][form_for] we set up sends a `POST` request to
`/chat_messages`. Therefore we will have to set up a route and a corresponding
action to handle the request.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

resources :chat_messages, only: [:create]
```

and

```ruby
# app/controllers/chat_messages_controller.rb

def create
end
```

With that, the page now shows. Before continuing let's clean up the look a bit
by placing each label on a separate line.

```bash
$ rm app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
$ touch app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss
```

```scss
// app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss

#new_chat_message label {
  display: block;
}
```

![Chat interface](doc/assets/images/chat-interface.png)

I know, it looks amazing.

Let's try filling out the form and submitting it to see what happens.

We get:

![Missing template chat_messages/create](doc/assets/images/missing-template-chat-messages-create.png)

[Rails][rails] is trying to render the view `app/views/chat_messages/create`, but that's not what we want to happen. In fact, what we truly want to happen will take a couple more iterations so in the meantime let's just redirect to the home page and end this iteration.

```ruby
# app/controllers/chat_messages_controller.rb

def create
  redirect_to root_url
end
```

**Note:** We are indeed getting the form data as shown in the logs.
